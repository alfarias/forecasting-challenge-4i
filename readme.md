# 4Intelligence Forecasting Challenge

## Introduction
The challenge is divided in two cases: one about the TFP rate of USA, Canada and Mexico, and another about brazilian products export.<br>
The development was made with Python 3.7 using modules like Pandas for data processing, hvplot for charts and forecastings with Prophet. 

## Usage
All the modules used are on the `requirements.txt` file, which can be used to reproduce the code. <br>
Jupyter Notebooks are used to development.<br>
Just change the path variable on the notebooks and run the cells.<br>
The plots can't be viewed directly on Github, download them and open on jupyter notebook or nteract.

## Folders
* `data`: Contains the main data used for the forecasts.
* `docs`: Files with instructions for the tasks and support documents.
* `models`: Saved models from Prophet.
* `notebooks`: Notebooks used for the Cases 1 and 2, as ipynb and html (To open on Web Browsers). 
* `references`: Additional files with data and documents to help on forecasts.
* `reports`: Figures from the charts and csv files with the forecasts.
